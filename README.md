# Hi, I'm Finn  

I've been a graphic designer, researcher, fine dining pastry chef and an American Ninja Warrior coach. I wrote my first line of code at 11 to build a Roblox game, a few weeks later I designed my first ad to promote it. Since then, I've been focused on **marketing and tech**.

## What I Do  

- **Building [Madison Marketing](https://github.com/madisonmarketing)** – an AI-powered marketing analytics platform  
- **Full-stack development** – Kotlin, Ktor, React, Next.js  
- **Performance marketing** – specializing in tech and entertainment industries
